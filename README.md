# Workshop 2 (Week 5)

## Getting Started

This repo contains the completed code for this week's workshop, along with instructions and other resources for you to learn more.

We assume you have completed the code from workshop 1. We will be changing the React we coded last week, but any CSS or other code you added shouldn't be affected. You can clone the week 1 repository if you want a clean slate.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cruizeship/devx-week1.git
npm install
```
